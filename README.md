# Employee-Payroll-Tracker
Hi!

## Description
This repository contains HTML, CSS and primarily JavaScript used to create an employee payroll tracker.

After entering your employee information, if you enter the console window in your browser dev tools by right-clicking your window and clicking 'Inspect', you may see the average salary of your entered employees as well as a randomly selected employee.

Below is an image of the website as well as a link to the deployed application.
